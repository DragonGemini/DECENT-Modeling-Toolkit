# DECENT-Modeling-Toolkit
We propose that finding a sound governance solution for various ecosystems with decentralized features
is a design problem. As the idea of decentralization is gradually introduced into different application
domains and contexts, there is an increasing need to develop a model based approach that is suitable
for designing decentralized governance models. From the model development perspective, different
ecosystems and governance cases face different contexts and the required components/system components
will be different. To avoid serious problems such as system centralization, inefficiencies or missing
important information that may arise from improper design, we developed a model-based approach to
design decentralized governance, positioned as DECENT {decentralized}. Here you can find several documents for installing the modeling toolkit 
that allows for designing decentralized governance
